# Solving the Regenerator Location Problem with an Iterated Greedy approach

The evolution of digital communications has resulted in new services thatrequire from secure and robust connections.  Nowadays, a signal must be trans-mitted to distant nodes, and the quality of the signal deteriorates as the distancebetween the endpoints increases.  Regenerators are special components that areable to restore the signal, in order to increase the distance that the signal cantravel without losing quality.  These special components are very expensive todeploy and maintain and, for this reason, it is desirable to deploy the minimumnumber  of  regenerators  in  a  network.   We  propose  a  metaheuristic  algorithmbased on the Iterated Greedy methodology to tackle the Regenerator LocationProblem, whose objective is to minimize the number of regenerators required ina network.  The extensive computational experiments show the performance ofthe proposed method compared with the best previous algorithm found in thestate of the art.

## Datasets

Instances are categorized in different datasets inside the 'instances' folder. 


## Code and executable

(Code & executables upload pending paper publication)

You can just run the RLP.jar as follows.

```
java -jar RLP.jar
```

If you want new instances just replace folder instances.
Solution folder contains de output per instance and folder experiments has all grouped in an excel file.
