# Solving the Regenerator Location Problem with an Iterated Greedy approach

The evolution of digital communications has resulted in new services that require from secure and robust connections.  Nowadays, a signal must be transmitted to distant nodes, and the quality of the signal deteriorates as the distancebetween the endpoints increases.  Regenerators are special components that areable to restore the signal, in order to increase the distance that the signal cantravel without losing quality.  These special components are very expensive to deploy and maintain and, for this reason, it is desirable to deploy the minimumnumber  of  regenerators  in  a  network.   We  propose  a  metaheuristic  algorithmbased on the Iterated Greedy methodology to tackle the Regenerator LocationProblem, whose objective is to minimize the number of regenerators required ina network.  The extensive computational experiments show the performance ofthe proposed method compared with the best previous algorithm found in thestate of the art.

## Datasets

Instances are categorized in different datasets inside the 'instances' folder. 


## Code and executable

You can just run the RLP.jar as follows.

```
java -jar RLP.jar
```

To solve new instances just replace `instances` folder.

`Solution` folder contains output per instance and `experiments` folder has all results grouped in a Microsoft Excel file.
